The annotations file is a spreadsheet where each row contains a "triple" consisting of two ontology IDs (wherever possible) and a relationship type. Ontology IDs are not always available, and in those cases, a name is given without an accompanying ID. 

The relationship types are listed as text only, they have not yet been formalised and mapped to RO relations. 

Accompanying notes include references for the annotation. 

These annotations were manually assembled by Jeanette Chacon Candia during her internship at EMBL-EBI in 2014
